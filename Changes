Revision history for Control-CLI

1.00    2011-03-27
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

1.01    2011-04-03
	* Module installation test script now requires (build_requires) Net::Telnet
	* Changed test script for detection of Serial port under unix which was not working on most Linux systems
	* Ported Device::SerialPort ability to manually specify a TESTPORT=<DEVICE> when running Makefile.PL/Build.PL
	* Added use of Exporter module for optionally importing class methods

1.02    2011-05-08
	* Still a few Linux systems where my serial port detection failed; modified the test script
	* Corrected uninitialized $fh warning in input_log, output_log, dump_log when no argument and telnet connection 

1.03    2011-08-24
	* Implemented eof() method
	* Corrected sleep timer in readwait() which was doing non-blocking reads much faster than 0.1 seconds intervals
	* Corrected read() which was not logging to input/dump logs in non-blocking mode for SSH & Serial, if read buffer was "0"
	* Login stage variable was not re-initialized correctly after a disconnect(); could cause errors on subsequent login()

1.04    2013-01-04
	* Reversed a change made in 1.03 under readwait, older versions of Perl generate a warning when doing length(undef)
	* Net-SSH2's eof does not seem to work; modified eof method to make it behave consistently for both Telnet & SSH
	* SSH stderr is now merged onto regular channel; using Net-SSH2 ext_data('merge') call
	* Implemented ssh_channel() method to be able to return underlying SSH channel object
	* Module now detects errors from SerialPort's read_const_time used before reads and updates eof
	* When errmode() is set to $arrayref the error message is now appended as the last argument to &$coderef
	* Added an interactive mode to the test script so that a connection to a device can be easily tested after installation
	* Enhanced alternative form of login() method allows login sequence/banner to be captured and returned
	* Modified default login/password prompts expected by login() method
	* Implemented break() method
	* No more calls to debug() method when the debug level is not changed; eliminates carping from Device::SerialPort

1.05    2013-08-25
	* As of this version, Telnet & SSH connections can now be run over IPv6, as long as IO::Socket::IP is installed
	* SSH failed connection now gives error message "SSH unable to connect" instead of "SSH unable to password authenticate"
	* Net-SSH2 (libssh2) eof still not working, and now returning a different error on disconnection; updated eof method
	* Some devices have a crude SSH implementation with no authentication and instead use an interactive login after the SSH
	  connection is established (just like Telnet does); the connect() method is now changed to allow these SSH connections
	* Added connection_timeout for Telnet and SSH connections; previously no consistent connection timeout was enforced
	* Method connect() now accepts '$host [$port]' which will work for IPv6 addresses; syntax '$host[:$port]' is deprecated
	* Serial port disconnect() now flushes recent writes before closing the connection; needed with Device::SerialPort
	* Method waitfor() now catches invalid Perl regular expression patterns passed to it and performs the error mode action
	* Added a flush_credentials method to undefine stored credentials
	* Code changes to pass Perl Critic severity 4 and above violations

1.06	2014-04-21
	* Method login() in list context did not return output received from host device if the login failed
	* Version 1.05 on MSWin32 was not working anymore with newest Net::Telnet 3.04 (due to bug id 94913); added workaround

2.00	2014-12-31
	* As of this version, methods connect(), login(), cmd() and waitfor() support a non-blocking mode for
	  which they now have a poll method: connect_poll(), login_poll(), cmd_poll() and waitfor_poll()
	* New generic non-blocking poll() object/class method to poll multiple objects of this class simultaneously
	* Method waitfor() was incorrectly setting s option on match, i.e. treating string as single line (. matches a newline)
	* Method change_baudrate() was incorrectly returning undef if the requested baudrate was already set
	* Error mode 'die' would always show CLI.pm as the die file and not the actual file where the error occurred
	* Error message for blocking read() timeout was incorrectly reported as "Received eof from connection"
	* Timer for readwait() method, previously hard coded to 100 millisecs, is now configurable via readwait_timer() method
	* Method break() now accepts a configurable duration argument for generating break signal over serial port connections
	* Prompt_credentials now resets Term::ReadKey ReadMode to whatever was in use before calling connect() / login()
	* Debug levels are now bit based; only bits 1 & 2 are defined in this class; new debugMsg() method for sub-classes
	* Added a socket method to return the IO::Socket::IP or IO::Socket::INET object
	* Fixed "Can't call method "ext_data" on an undefined value at Control/CLI.pm line X" which was caused by SSH
	  connecting to a device that only accepts publickey authentication, with no keys provided
	* SSH & Serial, methods input_log, output_log and dump_log were not returning the filehandle when called with no arguments
	* All methods now handle error mode correctly if called before a connection is established or after disconnect
	* Added a connected() method to check status of connection
	* Carp messages from Win32::SerialPort are now always suppressed, unless debug level is active on bit1
	* Method change_baudrate() now can also be used to change Parity, Databits, Stopbits and Handshake settings
	* Method read(Blocking => 1, Timeout => $secs) using Device::SerialPort was ignoring the Timeout argument
	* SSH connect() is now able to also handle keyboard-interactive authentication method
